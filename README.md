# Artificial Invaders

[Artificial Invaders](https://robotuprising.fi/hackathon/artificial-invaders/) is a story-driven, strategic robotics game designed for hacker teams experienced in Artificial Intelligence and Robotics.

Artificial Invaders consists of two phases: ``pre-challenges`` and ``a physical robot battle tournament``. The pre-challenges are part of our qualification process of the tournament. The best 10 teams will be selected to fight for the supremacy of the Robot Uprising universe. 

Schedule:

- Pre-challengs (1st phase) 19.06.-1.19.19
- Tournament (2nd phase) 11.-13.10.19 

## Pre-Challenges

Pre-challenges ensure that your team has the crucial skills and they also give instructions how some techonologies could be used in the tournament. The pre-challenge phase will culminate into a full battle against other competitors on the simulation platform. 

The simulation platform is [``Webots``](https://cyberbotics.com/), which is an open source robotics simulation software. It is avaible for ``Windows``, ``Linux`` and ``macOS``. 

In Webots, you can easily model custom robots and control them by using ``C``, ``C++``, ``Java``, ``Python``, ``Matlab`` or ``Ros``. The code that is written for the simulation can be reused easily with the real physical robot running on for instance Arduino or Rasberry Pi.  

For the pre-challenges, we will provide you a premade robot model and the scenario. So, you can focus on the crucial robotic skills, e.g. coding and AI. In other words, no need to spent time learning Webots thoroughly. You only have to know, how to run simulation, and how to insert your amazing code in to the simulation.
